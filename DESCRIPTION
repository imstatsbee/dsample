Description: Discretization-based random sampling algorithm that is useful for a complex model in high dimension is implemented. The normalizing constant of a target distribution is not needed. Posterior summaries are compared with those by OpenBUGS. The method is described: Wang and Lee (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.06.011> and exercised in Lee (2009) <http://hdl.handle.net/1993/21352>.
